# Project Summary

The first chart is a word cloud chart, by counting the number of shooting cases by state, we can directly identify which states have most shooting cases.

As we can see, California, Texas and Florida have the most shooting cases.

The next charts are treemap, pie chart, and distribution plot. 

Treemap is a good way to visualize the percentage, especially there are so many unique values. From our treemap, we can find the around 50% shooting case happened to white people, around 25% shooting case happened to black people.

From pie chart, we can see most cases happened to male, which takes around 90%.

From distribution plot, we can see how the age distributed across all ages. Most of people been shot by police are around 30. The youngest one is barely an adult, and the oldest one is already over 80.

The last plot I wanna show is a line chart, from this line chart, we can find there are 2 peaks in ervery year, March and July. This can provide an interesting insight to the police.
